History

About Bookient - much more than a reservation system
The development of Bookient initiated in 2011 with a team of four
programmers and a project manager. Project CTO had gained over 10 years of
experience in scheduling solutions through his past position with a leading
scheduling solution provider. During this time the need for a next
generation scheduling solution became clear and was supported by customer
feedback. “We had witnessed first hand the demands brought about from moving
scheduling on-line and the opportunities this presented for the future of
scheduling solutions.”

Today, electronic scheduling solutions are expected by the customers of
service industry businesses. We at Bookient feel there is an opportunity for
a scheduling solution to be so much more than just a reservation management
tool. It has the potential to become a way for service sector businesses to
manage their entire business operations through a single solution. This was
the inspiration and basis for the development of Bookient.

Bookient’s mission since the beginning has been to improve small businesses
competitiveness while helping them grow their business through the
automation of customer relationship management and marketing processes.

The Bookient system was developed over a 4 year period with over 20 000
programming hours creating a comprehensive solution which was continuously
compared with industry needs to ensuring it meets the demands of Bookient
users. Through an external global competitor analysis, Bookient was found to
be a leading scheduling solution based on its features, price and
performance.

The scheduling solution is cloud based meaning it is accessible from
anywhere and on any device, making managing all aspects of your business
easy and convenient. Additionally, Bookient ensures available resources are
used efficiently, helps businesses gain new customers and makes managing
customer relations simple and convenient. The basic version of Bookient is
completely free.

The Bookient scheduling solution was initially designed for hair and beauty
salon businesses but as one of the most comprehensive scheduling solutions
available, it can easily be customized to meet the demands of any
businesses. Bookient will also soon be available pre-configured for a
variety of service businesses, making setting up Bookient for your business
quick and easy.

Bookient is perfect for businesses of any size and its scalability allows it
to grow with your business meaning switching your scheduling solution along
the way will not be necessary. We are continuously developing new
integrations to ensure our system is compatible with existing ones, making
Bookient the best solution for managing all your businesses scheduling
needs.

At June 2015 we decided to license Bookient as Open Source
